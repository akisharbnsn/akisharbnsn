## 🌟 About Me  

I’m a lifelong learner and builder at heart. My career has taken me across industries and continents — and each pivot has been intentional, grounded in purpose, curiosity, and service.

**Educator → Project Manager**  
I began my career shaping young minds, designing literacy-driven experiences, and leading with empathy. That foundation in communication and structured thinking grew into project management, where I learned how to drive initiatives, align teams, and deliver outcomes.

**Project Manager → AI & Analytics**  
Curiosity pulled me deeper into tech. I discovered how data tells stories, reveals patterns, and changes decisions. Today, I work in **Commercial Real Estate Risk** at Morgan Stanley, leading AI-driven appraisal review workflows, operational trackers, and digital transformation solutions.

**AI & Analytics → Entrepreneurial Creative**  
Beyond analytics, I build brands and experiences — from **Oshelly**, my emerging wine label, to interactive dashboards, learning tools, and event concepts. Reinvention fuels me.

## Hi there 👋

# 🌟 Akisha Robinson – My Ever-Evolving Journey

Hey there! I’m Akisha — a lifelong learner with a passion for empowering others and a knack for reinventing myself. Welcome to my personal GitHub portfolio, where curiosity meets creativity.

## ✨ About Me

From the chalkboard to the keyboard, I’ve worn many hats:

- **Educator ➔ Curriculum Designer:** I started my career in the classroom, igniting a love for literacy and helping students discover their voices.  
- **Tutor ➔ Project Manager:** Transitioning into one-on-one tutoring and educational leadership sparked my interest in strategy, organization, and bringing big ideas to life.  
- **Project Manager ➔ Data Enthusiast:** Craving a new challenge, I dove into tech to learn how data drives decisions, uncover patterns, and tell stories with numbers.  
- **Aspiring Data Analyst:** Today, I’m building skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization to bridge my love for teaching with technology and innovation.

Each pivot wasn’t just a career change — it was an intentional step toward merging purpose and passion.

## 🚀 Why Data Science?

I decided to pursue data science because I wanted to:

✅ Bring my curiosity and critical thinking to a new field  
✅ Translate complex data into actionable insights  
✅ Empower communities and businesses with informed decisions  
✅ Break barriers as a Black woman in tech, inspiring others to do the same

Data science, to me, isn’t just numbers — it’s storytelling with impact.
